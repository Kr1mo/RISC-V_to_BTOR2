\chapter{Benchmarks}\label{chap:benchmarks}
With a model implemented, I can test how good it runs. I run my
benchmarks on an Intel Core i5-6200U. Each test was run five times
and the resulting times averaged. I devised two base tests formed
from four RISC-V instructions as shown in
\figref{fig:base_test_risc}. Both have three instructions forming a
loop and one instruction as a \enquote{workhorse}. This program is
set into a state like shown in \figref{fig:bench_example}. In this,
x1 acts as a loop limiter, x2 as a loop counter and x3 as an
accumulator.
