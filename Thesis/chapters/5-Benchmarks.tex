\chapter{Benchmarks}\label{chap:benchmarks}
With a model implemented, I can test how good it runs. I run my
benchmarks on an Intel Core i5-6200U. Each test was run five times
and the resulting times averaged. I devised two base tests formed
from four RISC-V instructions as shown in
\figref{fig:base_test_risc}. I chose to implement one test with and
one without memory operation to be able to measure the impact memory
operations have in the model. For this reason the program for these
tests are very similar. Both have three instructions forming a loop
and one instruction as a \enquote{workhorse}. Their names also derive
from this instruction as add and write\_mem. This program is set into
a state. An example for this is found in \figref{fig:bench_example},
where the add program is set up for 256 iterations. In this, x1 acts
as a loop limiter, x2 as a loop counter and x3 as an accumulator. The
instructions are set in the first bytes of the memory.
