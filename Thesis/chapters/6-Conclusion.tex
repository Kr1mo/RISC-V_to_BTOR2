\chapter{Conclusion}
I developed tools to transition from a state to a model and from a
witness of this model back to a state. Additionally, I implemented a
fuzzer for the states to verify the correct functioning of the model,
as well as a set of basic tests to benchmark its performance.
Finally, I presented and discussed the results of these benchmarks,
concluding that model checkers which appear superior in general are
worse at this specific task of mainly running iterations.
