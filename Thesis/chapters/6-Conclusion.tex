\chapter{Conclusion}
I have explained RISC-V and BTOR2, described a way to hold a state of
a 64bit RISC-V processor and a BTOR2 model of a subset of RV64I, and
wrote tools to transition from state to a model and from a witness of
this model back to a state. Furthermore, I wrote a fuzzer for the
states to test the correct functioning of the model and some simple
tests to benchmark the model. Finally I presented the results of the
benchmarks and discussed them, finding that seemingly better model
checkers are actually not better for this special case.
