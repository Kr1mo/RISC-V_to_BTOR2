\chapter*{Abstract}

RISC-V is an open-source instruction set architecture that is
increasingly adopted in both research and industry due to its
flexibility and extensibility \cite{riscv-isa, eu}. Formal
verification, particularly bounded model checking, is essential for
ensuring the correctness of such architectures in safety-critical
contexts \cite{BiereBMC}. BTOR2 has become a standard format for
word-level hardware model checking \cite{btor2, HWMCC}.

This thesis presents tools for translating RISC-V processor states
into BTOR2 models and reconstructing states from model checker
witnesses. The correctness of the models is validated by comparing
single-instruction execution against a reference RISC-V simulator
\cite{repoSim}. Benchmarking is performed to evaluate the feasibility
of this approach using the model checkers btormc, AVR, and Pono
\cite{btor2, avrPaper, ponoPaper}, with respect to instruction count,
address space, and memory initialization. The results show that model
checkers which perform best in general competitions do not
necessarily excel for my iteration-heavy RISC-V models..
